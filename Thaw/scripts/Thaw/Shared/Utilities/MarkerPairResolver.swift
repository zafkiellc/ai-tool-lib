/// Pairs unresolved on-screen menu bar icons with bundle-ID-titled
/// marker windows so their NSStatusItem sourcePIDs can be recovered
/// after the spatial AX pass fails.
///
/// On macOS 26 some widgets (Little Snitch's agent observed in the
/// wild) have their NSStatusItem hosted by Control Center at the AX
/// layer and do not publish an AXExtrasMenuBar of their own. The
/// CG-to-AX spatial resolver in SourcePIDCache cannot find a per-app
/// extras child for them, sourcePID stays nil, and the namespace
/// falls back to com.apple.controlcenter, colliding with Apple's real
/// Control Center items and with any other widget hit by the same
/// failure.
///
/// Structurally, every NSStatusItem-style widget also publishes a
/// SECOND CG window in the items-only list whose title is the
/// widget's bundle identifier and whose width matches the on-screen
/// icon (heights diverge: the icon takes the active display's menu
/// bar height while the marker carries a placeholder height). This
/// resolver pairs icons with markers by width and synthesizes the
/// sourcePID via injected lookups so the algorithm stays pure and
/// testable.
